# NFS(Network File System)

**NFS** was developed by Sun Microsystems in 1984. NFS is implemented using RPC(remote procedure call)(just as in NIS, which is another product of Sun Microsystems).

## Daemons

Daemon | Description
--- | ---
`rpcbind` | Remote procedure call daemon. Used to be `portmap`
`nfs-server` | NFS server daemon

## Server Configuration

`/etc/exports`

* Usage: Directory_path    Host(options)    [Host(options) ...]

```shell
$ vi /etc/exports
/nfsdata    192.168.5.13
/nfsdata1   192.168.5.0/255.255.255.0(rw,root_squash)  // Read write, map a client logging in as 'root' to 'nobody'
/nfsdata2   192.168.12.0/24(rw,no_root_squash)  // Allow 'root' to stay as 'root'
/nfsdata3   *.domain.or.kr(rw,all_squash)  // Map every account to 'nobody'(including 'root')
/home/heejoon    mymachine(rw,all_squash,anonuid=500,anongid=500)  // Map uid and gid to 500
```

## Commands

3. `nfsstat`

    Show NFS status. It can also be used in an NFS client.

### NFS Client

1. `mount.nfs`

    * Usage: `mount.nfs host_ip:dir mount_dir`

    * Examples

    `$ mount.nfs 192.168.5.13:/nfsdata /mnt`

    `$ mount -t nfs 192.168.5.13:/nfsdata /mnt` can also be used
